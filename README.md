# AgentFrame

AgentFrame is a file-native workspace harness designed to run inside AI coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, or Antigravity. The harness itself is completely domain-neutral. Currently, it supports marketing campaigns and project-management projects, utilizing modular domain packs that can be expanded in the future. The workflow runs through two `AGENTS.md` modes: **Operator** handles project execution, and **Builder** manages system architecture and templates.

This is my workspace where I build and run my projects—longer-term projects, campaigns, and tools. Evolving this codebase is a direct reflection of the type of work that I do day-to-day. Evolving this workspace helps keep the agent focused, fast, and organized. It is free to fork, so feel free to take whatever is useful for your own setups.

## Quick start

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/situhacks/agentframe.git
   cd agentframe
   ```

2. **Open the folder in your coding agent** of choice (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, or Antigravity). If you are using Claude Code, it automatically loads `CLAUDE.md` which imports the active `AGENTS.md` persona, pinning the agent's behavior so it survives memory compaction.

3. **Configure environment variables.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add optional keys for Gemini (used for Deep Research and image generation) and Composio (used for platform publishing). Both are optional; the system will run locally without them, but you will lose external API connections. If you intend to use Open Design for local visual rendering, run `corepack pnpm install` inside `system/skills/open-design/source/`.

4. **Scaffold a new project.** Instruct the agent to **"start a new marketing campaign"** or **"start a new project-management project"**. Under the hood, the agent runs `af new-project <slug> --domain <marketing|project-mgmt>` to read the domain pack and scaffold the directory structure.

### Mode swaps

AgentFrame uses two distinct `AGENTS.md` personas to establish clean boundaries:

- **Operator mode** runs active projects. It is locked to `workspace/projects/` so the agent cannot edit templates, rules, or core processes while executing a project.
- **Builder mode** modifies the system. It has write access to `system/` and `library/` for editing templates, adding process files, or authoring domain packs.

You can swap modes by telling the agent `swap to Builder` or `swap to Operator`. The agent will handle the file copy and log the transition to the local audit database automatically. The boundary is enforced, not just described: the swap refuses to overwrite a drifted `AGENTS.md`, and the CLI's operator verbs (`lock`, `publish`, `version`, `new-project`) refuse to run while the Builder persona is active.

### Syncing upstream changes

This system evolves as I run more projects. To pull the latest system updates without losing your local changes, swap to Builder and tell the agent to **"pull upstream updates"**. The sync skill fetches this repository, walks you through changes commit-by-commit, prompts you for how to resolve local customization conflicts, and applies the updates safely. All personal layers—including project workspaces, local logs, and audit databases—are gitignored and remain untouched.

## Why this exists

I built the original AgentFrame system to run marketing campaigns because I realized that working on copy and strategy in raw chat windows meant losing context and having files drift over a long campaign. Keeping everything structured and anchored as files in a local workspace makes it much easier to coordinate work over long horizons.

Over time, I wanted to use this workspace and its skills for other tasks: making slide decks, writing emails, and archiving or tracking project details—all related to project management. At first, I jerry-rigged these skills and processes into the `open-flow` style to make it work. It worked fine for short-term tasks, but it wasn't scalable for long-term projects.

To solve this, I rebuilt AgentFrame to support structured projects and long-horizon work. The new architecture introduces context components—like global profiles for people and channels—along with a dedicated memory and consolidation system.

This design aligns with where the industry is moving, where specialized domain packs (like Claude for Financial Services or Claude for Small Business) are added on top of a core platform. AgentFrame applies that same modular pattern to local workspaces, but adds a robust context and memory layer to keep the workspace lightweight and cost-effective as it evolves over time.

The original marketing-only project is frozen at [agentframe-marketing](https://github.com/situhacks/agentframe-marketing). This repository is its multi-domain successor.

## Domains are packs

Everything in AgentFrame is built around domain separation. 

The core runner (`system/af.py`) and the routing files (`AGENTS.md`) carry no domain-specific code. If you search the python scripts for marketing terms or publishing platforms, you will find nothing; the engine is completely blind to what the project is actually about. All domain logic is declared in `library/domains/{domain}/`.

These are not code-heavy plugins. A domain pack is primarily a collection of deliverable templates—markdown shapes and rules for the files the project produces—along with a small metadata descriptor. All generic skills like research, voice harvesting, and document generation live outside the pack, allowing any domain to use them.

A pack defines its scope through a few key files:

- **Deliverable templates** (`deliverables/`): The templates for the artifacts this domain generates.
- **A pack descriptor** (`pack.md`): Declares custom frontmatter fields, valid CLI verbs, and folder structures. The python runner parses this directly using standard library helpers.
- **A scaffold skeleton** (`skeleton.md`): Defines the initial structure of `project.md` when the project is created.
- **An optional rules module** (`rules.py`): Python validation rules loaded dynamically by `af doctor` (for example, verifying character limits or document groupings).
- **An optional routing fragment** (`production.md`): Domain-specific step instructions that the Operator mode loads on demand during execution.

Adding support for a new workflow only requires adding a folder under `library/domains/`; the Accept-Test for the design is that a new domain requires zero modifications to the core engine.

## A real project, step by step

Here is what an end-to-end run looks like in each of the two domains that ship today—one operator, six steps, no handoffs.

### Project management — a project

The PM pack takes a charter, derives living project context files, and tracks deliverables ad-hoc.

## The deterministic harness

A project harness is more than just a folder of files; it requires a way to maintain state, validate structure, and enforce boundaries. AgentFrame is a lightweight, pragmatically built harness. It does not solve every agent coordination problem, but it addresses a very real issue: LLMs are great at drafting but notoriously bad at state tracking and bookkeeping. In my experience, even the best frontier models fail at exact procedure following a significant percentage of the time—mine skipped its versioning and lock steps three times in a single evening (likely because it got distracted).

Because of this, AgentFrame does not ask the model to remember state transitions. Instead, the workflow is guided by a deterministic Python CLI (`system/af.py`). Commands like `new-project`, `version`, `lock`, and `doctor` run the exact file modifications, frontmatter updates, and audit logs atomically. They print back the check-lists and guidelines that the agent actually needs to follow. The agent owns the creative judgment; the CLI owns the bookkeeping. Since the CLI is written in standard library Python, it runs identically across Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, or Antigravity.

---

## Key features

### A voice system built from your own writing

Most brand-voice setups rely on a long list of negative rules ("don't use the word leverage") that the agent forgets by the second revision anyway. AgentFrame compiles your actual writing into annotated example pairs—showing a generic version, your rewritten version, and the specific move that separates them. 

When the agent drafts, it loads these pairs directly into its context to act as stylistic anchors. Instead of checking off a list of banned words, the agent drafts the substance first, then runs a dedicated style pass applying the exact cadences and markers found in the pairs. This keeps the writing authentic to how you actually talk, without relying on crude system prompts.

### A structured project knowledge substrate

Long-horizon projects quickly bloat the agent's active context window with historical chat logs and outdated files. AgentFrame prevents this by separating raw, immutable inputs (transcripts, briefings, and raw docs in `sources/`) from agent-distilled living files (logs and plans in `knowledge/`).

As the project moves forward, you can trigger a consolidation pass (the "dream" workflow) that archives resolved risks, closed decisions, and completed milestones into compressed monthly archives. This strips the bloat from the active workspace files, keeping the agent's context window slim, fast, and cost-effective.

### Deep research built on an open benchmark

Research is a first-class phase in every project, and at kickoff the agent offers you a method: Gemini Deep Research over the API, or a native `deep-research` skill that runs entirely on the agent's own tools — web search, page fetch, file I/O. The native path needs no research API and no per-run billing beyond the session's own token usage, so it works on any harness out of the box.

The native skill follows the same rule as every other skill in this repo: vendor proven work instead of reinventing it. Rather than drafting my own research loop, I started from [DeepResearch Bench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/muset-ai/DeepResearch-Bench-Leaderboard) — an open benchmark for deep-research agents — and lifted the loop from its top open-source performers:

- The **role-specialized architecture** (an architect plans typed queries, then five specialist roles — evidence gatherer, mechanism explorer, comparator, critic, horizon scanner — extract cited finding atoms) comes from NVIDIA's AI-Q blueprint, the benchmark's #1 entry, as adapted by [LunonAI/lunon-deep-research](https://github.com/LunonAI/lunon-deep-research) (MIT).
- The **synthesis-gate checklist** that decides whether findings are strong enough to write from comes from ByteDance's [deer-flow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow) (MIT).
- The **compression-at-boundary pattern** (only structured finding atoms cross into the writer's context; raw page text never persists) comes from LangChain's [open_deep_research](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research) (MIT).

Every lifted element is pinned to an upstream commit SHA in [`PROVENANCE.md`](system/skills/deep-research/PROVENANCE.md), with a refresh procedure: diff upstream against the pin, adopt what changes the research loop, ignore the rest. Same discipline as the fully vendored skills, applied at the prompt level.

Just as deliberate is what was *not* lifted: the benchmark-judge tuning (readability rewriters, footnote normalizers) and the multi-model API ensembles. Those optimize leaderboard score, not research quality — and the point of the native skill is running on whatever model your session already has. Benchmark-scale budgets (48–64 queries per run) were cut down to operator-sized tiers (`quick` / `standard` / `deep`), and the skill states its cost — execution mode, tier, search count, specialist model — before launching the expensive wave.

### A learning loop

Every project closes with an automated harvest pass. Two system skills analyze the project's version history and your manual edits. One skill extracts new voice example pairs from how you polished the agent's drafts, while the other identifies template and process gaps based on how the workflow actually ran. The agent proposes these updates as git-patch suggestions; you review and approve them, allowing the system to naturally evolve with every project you run.

## At a glance

The system is composed of a few simple layers: 2 domain packs, 5 shared deliverables, 18 process files, 18 skill bundles, 4 flows, a reusable asset library, a two-mode persona configuration, a deterministic CLI, a local preview server, and a two-layer audit trail.

Everything in `library/` and `system/skills/` is plain text or standard Python, meant to be modified. You set your voice and positioning once under `library/context/operator/` (generated on first run from the canonical shapes in `library/context/operator-schema/`) and they are reused automatically across all projects.

### Domain packs

| Pack | What it ships |
|---|---|
| `library/domains/marketing/` | Campaigns that ship posts. Deliverables: research, business brief, campaign brief, campaign architecture, slide-copy, body-copy, post-final. The `publish` verb and the post-FINAL assembly live here. |
| `library/domains/project-mgmt/` | Consulting / PM projects. Opt into `project-mgmt-open-flow` and a charter goes in, then four living governance docs are derived from it: RAID log, stakeholder map, decision log, workback schedule. One-off PM deliverables run on plain `open-flow` with no governance overhead. No posts, no publish. |
| `library/domains/TBD/` | The harness is domain-neutral. More domain packs can be added at any time to support any kind of workflow. |

### Flows

`open-flow` is the default across every domain. Add or edit any flow under `library/process/flows/`.

| Flow | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `open-flow` (default) | Build-as-you-go. The agent proposes a plan scaled to the objective; you narrow it and set the tempo. The default for every domain. |
| `marketing-solo-flow` | Marketing, opt-in: a lean fixed phase ladder with one accountable owner. |
| `marketing-standard-flow` | Marketing, opt-in: a fuller campaign with stakeholder review gates. |
| `project-mgmt-open-flow` | Project-mgmt, opt-in: open-flow plus a governance kickoff that derives the charter-driven governance docs. One-off PM deliverables stay on plain `open-flow`. |

### Shared deliverables

Cross-domain templates under `library/deliverables/`.

| Template | Output |
|---|---|
| `design-language` | Visual and style direction |
| `image-prompts` | Per-asset generation prompts — treatment block + per-asset deltas |
| `video-spec` | Video concept, scenes, and production plan |
| `closeout-retro` | Project-level learnings and improvements |
| `system-retro` | System-level process and architecture improvements |
| `_meta` | The generic deliverable shape every template inherits |

### Process files

Process files load on demand — only when the workflow they describe is in play.

| Process | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `flow-authoring` | Designing or evolving flows |
| `process-authoring` | Designing or evolving process files |
| `research-and-signals` | Shared kickoff research: workspace context, live MCP scan, research-method offer |
| `deliverable-versioning` | Surgical-vs-replacement judgment for `*-v{N}.md`; bumps run through `af version` |
| `lock-event` | Lock trigger and judgment gates; mechanics run through the `af` CLI |
| `project-frontmatter` | Frontmatter schema and state handling |
| `knowledge-base` | Project knowledge substrate schema, storage principles, and ingest workflow |
| `operator-context-setup` | First-run generation of your operator context from the canonical schemas |
| `voice-setup` | Build your voice system from your own writing |
| `voice-mini-retro` | Lock-time gate that routes your edit-diffs to the voice-harvest skill |
| `humanizer-integration` | The humanization pass |
| `image-production` | Image-generation workflow |
| `video-production` | Video workflow from spec to renders |
| `deck-production` | Deck path selection (PPTX skill, PPT Master, Open Design) |
| `preview-server` | When and how to use the local preview hub |
| `composio-notes` | Connector usage notes and caveats |
| `browser-fallback` | Browser-automation fallback strategy |
| `substack-distribution-notes` | Substack publishing conventions |

### Skills

My current production stack — swap any one for a sharper tool without touching templates or processes.

| Skill | Source |
|---|---|
| `agentframe-structure` | Project skill — navigates and understands the overall project architecture and state |
| `deliverable-scaffolding` | Project skill — scaffolds new deliverables from templates with correct frontmatter |
| `system-improvement` | Project skill — applies patches and improvements to the system itself |

### Everything else in the box

- Two-mode routing via `AGENTS.operator.md` and `AGENTS.builder.md`.
- The deterministic CLI at `system/af.py` — `new-project`, `lock`, `version`, `doctor`, plus the domain-dispatched `publish`. The buttons do the bookkeeping atomically and write the paper trail; the agent keeps the judgment.
- Project state and outputs as markdown under `workspace/projects/`.
- A reusable asset library at `library/assets/` — a flat logo inventory plus ppt-master deck-template packages, shared across every deck the projects produce.
- A two-layer audit trail: `activity.md` per project plus an append-only SQLite DB at `system/audit/agentframe.db`.
- A local preview server at `system/server/` for HTML, image, video, PDF, PPTX, and DOCX.
- A browser harness at `system/browser/` for CDP-driven sessions, with documented fallbacks when a workflow needs a hand.

## Design principles

### File-native state

All project state lives directly in markdown files—including frontmatter, deliverables, and `activity.md` log files. The active state is never locked in a transient chat session. If you change LLM providers, switch machines, or return to a project after months away, the agent can read the directory and resume the work immediately.

### Token efficiency by design

`AGENTS.md` is the only file loaded into the agent's context by default. All domain packs, flows, processes, and skills are lazy-loaded only when the current step requires them. Keeping the active context small prevents LLM drift, keeps response times fast, and lowers token costs.

### A durable library with swappable tools

Your templates, processes, domain packs, and voice rules are the long-term assets of this workspace—the parts that accumulate value as you run more projects. The actual skills and API connectors are kept decoupled. You can swap an image generator, doc converter, or browser library for a newer tool without altering your underlying workflow.

[Back to top](#agentframe)

---

## Connectors

AgentFrame integrates with external services to support research, media generation, and publishing. All integrations are optional, and the system runs locally without them.

### Gemini Deep Research

- Generates detailed research briefs, competitor analysis, and signal maps at project kickoff.
- Outputs are saved directly to `phase-1-research/` as structured markdown.
- Uses `GEMINI_API_KEY` (which can be obtained through a standard Google AI Studio developer account).
- No key? The native `deep-research` skill covers the same phase on the agent's own tools — see [Deep research built on an open benchmark](#deep-research-built-on-an-open-benchmark).

### Gemini Image Generation (Nano & Pro)

- Used to generate quick layout variants or high-fidelity images with inline text.
- Integrated through the local preview hub and runs using your shared `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

### Composio

- Acts as a unified MCP gateway to connect your agent to tools like Google Workspace, Slack, LinkedIn, or YouTube.
- Collects live context signals for project kickoff research and publishes final content directly to social channels.

### Open Design

- A bundled local-first design runtime at `system/skills/open-design/source/` used to compile SVGs, slides, and carousels.
- Requires Node 24 and local dependencies (`corepack pnpm install`).

### `.env` shape

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=
COMPOSIO_API_KEY=
COMPOSIO_MCP_URL=https://connect.composio.dev/mcp
```

Your coding agent provides the LLM. These keys power the non-LLM tools — research, image generation, and publishing.

## Architecture

### Mode boundary

```text
                                  ┌─── owns ──▶  workspace/projects
                  ┌──── Operator ─────┤
                  │              └─── reads ─▶  system + library
   Operator ──────┤
                  │              ┌─── owns ──▶  system + library

                                 └─── reads ──▶  workspace/projects

   ── swap AGENTS.md to flip between modes ──
```

### The load path — one domain parameter, one resolution point

```text
   CLAUDE.md  ── imports ──▶  AGENTS.md   (the active persona; domain-agnostic)
                                  │
                                  ▼
                          project.md  →  { domain, flow, deliverables[] }
                                  │
              ┌───────────────────┼────────────────────────────┐
              ▼                   ▼                             ▼
   library/domains/{domain}/   library/process/flows/{flow}.md   library/process/* (shared)
        (the pack)              (domain-agnostic; open-flow)      (lock, versioning, frontmatter)
              │
              ▼
   draft X → pack's template ▸ shared template ▸ generic _meta shape
```

`af.py` reads `project.md` → `domain` → loads the pack and dispatches. The persona, the flows, and the shared processes name no domain; `{domain}` is the single point where the work is parameterized.

## Preview server

<details>
<summary>Show preview server details</summary>

- Local preview hub at `system/server/`.
- Previews HTML, images, video, PDF, PPTX, and DOCX.
- Folder-tree navigation with hide rules to keep noise down.
- Run with `py -3 system/server/run.py`.

</details>

## Auditability and state

<details>
<summary>Show auditability details</summary>

- Project layer: `activity.md` in each project for the human-readable timeline — state transitions through `system/af.py` write it automatically.
- System layer: append-only SQLite audit DB at `system/audit/agentframe.db` (writer: `system/audit/writer.py`).
- Books check: `python system/af.py doctor [project]` verifies schema, head pointers, and per-domain rules; it surfaces drift and never auto-fixes.

## Roadmap

Small, demand-driven additions. Nothing here is a rewrite.

- [ ] Embedded / RAG indexing over the markdown corpus, so retrieval scales as the library grows past what fits in context.
- [ ] Scheduled runs — cron-triggered jobs for recurring work, like a weekly research pull or a digest.
- [ ] Agent-to-agent communication over an API, so projects and agents can hand work to each other.
- [x] Per-project knowledge substrate (`sources/` immutable + agent-owned `knowledge/`) with a user-triggered consolidation pass.
- [x] Cross-project context entities (channels, people) referenced by slug.
- [ ] More domain packs as the work demands them.
- [ ] Preview server v2: better search, nested live reload, stronger video UX.
